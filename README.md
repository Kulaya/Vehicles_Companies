The code imports the necessary libraries including csv, torch, BertTokenizer and BertModel from the Transformers library, and cosine_similarity from scikit-learn.

It loads a pre-trained BERT tokenizer and model (bert-base-uncased) for generating BERT embeddings.

The code reads vehicle brand data from a CSV file and stores it in the Brands list.

It iterates through the brands, tokenizes the brand descriptions using the BERT tokenizer, converts tokens to tensors, and generates BERT embeddings using the BERT model. The embeddings are then stored in the embeddings list.

The embeddings are reshaped and a cosine similarity matrix is computed based on the embeddings.

A user's liked brand (in this case, "Toyota") is used to find the most similar brands based on cosine similarity. The code identifies the index of the liked brand in the Brands list.

The most similar brand indices are obtained from the similarity matrix, excluding the liked brand itself. The top 2 recommended brands are selected.

The recommended brands are printed as output, indicating that they are recommended because the user liked "Toyota."
